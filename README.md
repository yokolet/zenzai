# Zenzai -- Red Bean Soup

The zenzai is a sweet red bean soup with mochi, which is popular in Japan.

This project is base on [jsoup](https://jsoup.org/), Java HTML parsing library.
The purpose is to add org.w3c.dom interfaces to node classes so that parsed documents can be
handled through W3C DOM API.
The final goal is to provide HTML5 feature to JRuby version of [Nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/index.html).
